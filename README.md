# War Anthology - Simulator and Game

Did you ever get bored playing the card game War? And have you ever wondered why you spent so much time playing a decisionless game? Don't worry, I got your back. This project will contain several exciting variations of the classic card game, as well as the option to run a simulator or to engage in individual battles. I hope that you are ready to enjoy War Anthology, whether or not you choose to engage in the tedious gameplay.

A big thanks to [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "War Variations") for the variations that I will be using.
